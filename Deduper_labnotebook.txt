DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR HARD CLIPPING add into -h argument into argparse 

Dedupes must share:
Chorome (Sam col 3)
UMI (end of Qname)
5' strand of read 
    if on +: 
        align position (1 based left most) - Col 4 IF NO SOFT CLIP CAN USE THIS 
                    IF SOFT CLIPPING: Look at Cigar string (Col 6)
                    Left hand soft clipping: alignposition-left hand soft clip 
    if on -:
        align position (col 4) 
        IF SOFT clipping 
        left hand: alignment position + the M letter number 
        parse cigar string  
            align position + M's + right hand soft clipping + deletion + N's 
            ignore the I's and left hand soft clipping 
            deletion - gap in target sequence 
strand(Bitwise flag Col2 bit 16)

Today, I am trying to get my adjust cigar position function to work, it wokrs on cigar strings but it counts soft clipping on both sides  :( 

need to change my code so that it adjusts according to these rules:
if it is the plus strand:
    it will only count S's on the left side of the M's and ignores any S's after
        adjusted position = positiion (int(line.split()[3])) + lefthand soft clipping + # M's + # of D' + # of N'S
if it is the minus strand:
    it will only count S's on the right side of the M and ignore any S's on the left side 
        adjusted position = positiion (int(line.split()[3])) +right hand soft clipping # M's + # of D' + # of N'S

I've made a little progress... I am asking Jason for help via slack and giving up on this for now 
So yay i got it to work... now i need to figure out the best way to implement it into my code  problem for another day :)

Today, I want to make a better execution plan for working on this thorughout the week. First, I need to implement some changes I saw that were required by leslie in the syllabus.
First being chaning the UMI list file into argpasrse
umis="/projects/bgmp/klindley/bioinfo/Bi624/dedup/Deduper/STL96.txt"
I added a function "has soft clipping" to tackle the position issue... I need to figure out how to make it output position=posiiton if there is no soft clipping

Where I need to pick up next is figuring out how to save the first sam read into the alignment list, then hold the next line in memory, so comparisons can happen

Then, I need to figure out how to do the comparisons line 

Also, need to figure out what im doing with my intermediate file

WOndering if i should change my alignment list to a set? 

Need to implement these changes 
Include the following argparse options
-f, --file: designates absolute file path to sorted sam file
-o, --outfile: designates absolute file path to sorted sam file
-u, --umi: designates file containing the list of UMIs
-h, --help: prints a USEFUL help message and any assumptions your code makes (see argparse docs)
That is, your code must be able to run (in a single step) if given a command in the format:
./<your_last_name>_deduper.py -u STL96.txt -f <in.sam> -o <out.sam>

Need to also add uniq Uniq reads per chrom


Next time I want to make sure that my has_soft_clipping function checks for the correct soft clipping

I think my code is ready ish to try and go, so I am going to start trying to do it with my test.sam file 
./lindley_deduper.py -f test.sam -u /projects/bgmp/klindley/bioinfo/Bi624/dedup/Deduper/STL96.txt -o testing_my_script.txt
./lindley_deduper.py -f samtest.txt -u /projects/bgmp/klindley/bioinfo/Bi624/dedup/Deduper/STL96.txt -o testing_my_script.txt

/projects/bgmp/shared/deduper/C1_SE_uniqAlign.sam

cp /projects/bgmp/shared/deduper/C1_SE_uniqAlign.sam .

 will run samtools on it now 
 samtools sort C1_SE_uniqAlign.sam -o sorted_C1_SE_uniqAlign.sam

 ./lindley_deduper.py -f samtest.txt -u /projects/bgmp/klindley/bioinfo/Bi624/dedup/Deduper/STL96.txt -o testing_my_script.txt

./lindley_deduper.py -f test.sam -u /projects/bgmp/klindley/bioinfo/Bi624/dedup/Deduper/STL96.txt -o testing_my_script.txt
 MY SCRIPT WORKS CORRECTLY WAHOOOOOOOO
